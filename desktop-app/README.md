# Desktop App Starter (Electron)

This directory contains a lightweight Electron starter project. It launches a desktop window that loads the `index.html` file in this folder.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher.

## Setup

```bash
cd desktop-app
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command launches the Electron application in development mode.

## Project Structure

```
desktop-app/
├── package.json
├── main.js
├── preload.js
├── index.html
├── renderer.js
└── styles.css
```

- `main.js` bootstraps the Electron application and opens a window.
- `preload.js` exposes a safe bridge for renderer processes if you need to pass data from the main process.
- `index.html`, `renderer.js`, and `styles.css` define the UI.

## Customizing Without Coding

Fill in the requirement worksheets below so an engineer or AI assistant can implement the logic for you.

### Requirement Worksheet

- **App Goal:** _e.g., "Track personal tasks with reminders"_
- **Target Users:** _e.g., "Remote workers managing multiple projects"_
- **Key Screens:** _List each window or modal you envision_
- **Data Inputs:** _What information will users provide?_ 
- **Outputs / Reports:** _What results or summaries should be shown?_
- **Integrations:** _Any external APIs or services to connect?_ 
- **Offline Support:** _Should the app work without internet access?_
- **Security Notes:** _Authentication, encryption, or privacy considerations._

Document answers here and share them when requesting implementation work.

## Next Steps for Engineers / AI Assistants

1. Implement the UI and logic specified in the worksheet.
2. Add persistence (filesystem, SQLite, or cloud sync) as required.
3. Package the app using `electron-builder` or similar tools, once functionality is complete.
