# Web App Starter (Vite + Vanilla JS)

This directory houses a lightweight Vite project that serves as a canvas for web application ideas.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer

## Setup

```bash
cd web-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server opens in your browser automatically. Use `npm run build` to generate a production bundle and `npm run preview` to test the built output locally.

## Project Structure

```
web-app/
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js
└── src/
    ├── main.js
    └── style.css
```

- `index.html` bootstraps the application.
- `src/main.js` defines the interactive requirement worksheet.
- `src/style.css` contains the styling.

## Requirement Worksheet

- **Problem Statement:** _What user challenge does this web app address?_
- **Primary Users:** _Who benefits from the app?_ 
- **Key Interactions:** _List the workflows users must complete._ 
- **Data Handling:** _What needs to be stored, validated, or visualized?_ 
- **Success Metrics:** _How will you know the app is successful?_

Document your answers here before handing requirements to an engineer or AI assistant.

## Next Steps for Engineers / AI Assistants

1. Translate the worksheet into UI components and state management.
2. Integrate APIs, authentication, or databases as needed.
3. Harden the UX with error handling, accessibility, and testing.
